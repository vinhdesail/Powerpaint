Assignment Overview:
The purpose of this assignment was to get the set up for PowerPaint. 
By getting the base line done which would be the main frame look and settings, it will
be a sculpture for part B to be implemented. 
The hard part comes in part B when we draw the different shapes. 



Technical Impression:
This assignment provided me with a great challenge, I went into this assignment with a plan
of setting up part A in a way that would make part B more easy to work with. This made part A
a whole lot more difficult then I expected it to be. I wanted the whole frame layout to be 
completed before I started on the shapes. This was a great idea because when I worked on it
I realized if I have only did the minimum other things would be too difficult. Such as 
setting the little color icon on color choosing was mildly difficult. Another challenge was 
getting the image on the tools to show up, by adding it to the action instead of the button. 
The biggest problem I encounter during part A was time management, I need to extend this 
assignment before I could turn it in. I was able to plan enough time for the homework 
however something unexpected happened. The fire alarm went off last Thursday at the lab
which cause me to lose extra time for work thus I had to push the assignment back. 
Saving the "line draw" for the last thing I code was not a good idea. I found this to be 
a lot more time consuming than the other parts. This is no doubt the hardest part of the 
assignment and finding a way to save multiple drawing would be a challenge for part B.
